# #25 - [1000-digit Fibonacci number](https://projecteuler.net/problem=25)

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F₁ = 1 and F₂ = 1.
Hence the first 12 terms will be:

```
F₁ = 1
F₂ = 1
F₃ = 2
F₄ = 3
F₅ = 5
F₆ = 8
F₇ = 13
F₈ = 21
F₉ = 34
F₁₀ = 55
F₁₁ = 89
F₁₂ = 144
```

The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
