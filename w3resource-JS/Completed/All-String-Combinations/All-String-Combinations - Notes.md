# All String Combinations - Notes

Didn't get this first try because inside both `for loops`, I only placed a less than < instead of a <= which produced the wrong results:

## < in for loop

```
stringCombinations('dog');
'd, do, o'
```

## <= in for loop

```
stringCombinations('dog');
Result = 'd, do, dog, o, og, g'
```
