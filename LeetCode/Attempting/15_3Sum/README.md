# [15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/)

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers, are there elements _a, b, c_ in `nums` such that _a + b + c_ = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

### Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### Example:

```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```
