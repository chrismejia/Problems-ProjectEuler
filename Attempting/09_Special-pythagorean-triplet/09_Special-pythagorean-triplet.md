# Special pythgorean triplet

## Problem 9 - [Link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9)

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

```
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

For example:

```
3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
9 + 16 = 25
```

Therefore:

```
a + b + c
3 + 4 + 5
= 12
```

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which

```
a + b + c = 1000.
```

Find the product **abc**.
